        <h2>Jan 2021</h2>
        <p>Year 2 of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Took the 48" TV out of the living room and stored it in the garage. Now there's no TV in the house.
            We can still watch movies on a computer screen but it's a more deliberate, non-default process.</p>
        <p>Sī valēs, valeō. I'm learning Latin. I got a copy of <i>Wheelock's Latin</i> and am starting to work through it.
        It's difficult but I find it so interesting as a direct and indirect ancestor of English.</p>
        <p>After 2 years as President of Hollywood Curling I resigned my position. It was time to give someone
        else a chance and the responsibility was wearing on me. I'm still on the board but I took on a different officer position: Treasurer.</p>
        <p>Audiobooks: <i>The Likeness</i> by Tana French and <i>The Secret History</i> by Donna Tartt.</p>

        <h2>Dec 2020</h2>
        <p>Got married! December 21st, a winter solstice wedding. We did a tiny outdoor ceremony with Ethan's parents
            in their back yard. My parents and siblings joined on Zoom.</p>
