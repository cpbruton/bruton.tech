<h2>What I'm Up To Now</h2>
<ul>
<li>Year 2 of the pandemic. Still mostly locked down in Los Angeles, though the post-holiday surge seems to be subsiding.</li>
<li>I'm taking a break (and possibly permanently eliminating) Facebook and other social media. <a href="/journal/reinventing-my-digital-life/">See why</a>.</li>
<li>I'm trying to watch less TV. We took the 48" TV out of the living room and stored it in the garage. We can still watch movies
    on a computer screen but it's a more deliberate, non-default process.</li>
<li>Sī valēs, valeō. I'm learning Latin. I got a copy of <i>Wheelock's Latin</i> and am starting to work through it. I'm also continuing to learn Swedish
    using Duolingo.</li>
<li>After 2 years as President of Hollywood Curling I resigned my position. I'm still on the board but I took on a different officer position: Treasurer.</li>
</ul>
